- To create multiple instance using the same resource block we can make use of meta-arguments, such as count and for_each.

#### Provisioners
- Provisioners provide a way for us to carry out tasks such as running commands or scripts on remote resources or locally on the machine where terraform is installed.

- For example to run a bar script after a resource is created we can make use of the remote exec provisioner.
